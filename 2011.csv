Let me make this concrete by giving an example.

If I want to start working on a PHP project, I grab Zend Framework or Symfony and use the generator to kickstart a project, and choose the components I need from a rich set of (well integrated) libraries/components. Everything I need is provided by the framework, including the documentation which describes in detail how to lay out my application and how to use each individual component (possibly in combination with other components).

With Haskell I find myself scanning for libraries on Hackage and hoping that the library I picked works sufficiently well. (granted, in most cases it does, unlike PHP libraries). The quality of the documentation on how to use the individual libraries varies greatly. Documentation on how to integrate individual libraries with frameworks is generally non-existent.

Strong documentation that is easily accessible (or the lack thereof) is probably the most glaring weakness for Haskell.",4

* lack of easy cross-platform GUI solution (surprise surprise...)

(slightly offtopic but the fact that GHC7 does not support OSX 10.5 - which imho would be trivial to solve with some conditional compiling - is an extremely sad thing).

Finding out that you can't really use it for anything because it's so slow is painful.

A lot of libraries seem to rely on only having ""reference"" documentation, that is an index of every function. This is not enough: More documentation should be written geared towards use of the library. Index and reference is good for hacking the library or doing weird stuff, but when developing, I just want to grab the library and start using it in the way the developer intended.",5

* The error messages produced by GHC are not very helpful for a newcomer. I never understand what it is trying to tell me.

In approximately descending order of glaringness:

- Abstraction carries a performance penalty
In a language which prizes abstraction this is obviously absurd. Could maybe be helped with polymorphism-by-multiinstantiation (aka automatic specialization) with weak linking, like C++ templates do.

- Orphan instances and packages
The problem of ""I want an instance for a class from package A for the datatype from package B, but that means one of them has to depend on the other or I have to make an orphan"" hinders integration between packages way too much. My current preferred solution would be to allow parts of a package to 'weakly depend' on other packages, so that if some parts of package A weakly depend on package B, then B isn't required to install A - it will be built without those parts - but if B is installed later then the weakly dependent parts of A will automatically become available as well. This would remove a lot of the unpleasantness (and could be used for other things besides instances, of course).

- The module system sucks
Even as merely a means for managing names it's frustratingly under-capable. Importers have lots of control over how they import things (which is good), but are forced to exercise it too often because exporters have very little control over how they export them. It should be possible to (re)export names pre-qualified, for example, modules-within-modules, so that module authors can provide sane defaults, and importers should only need to manually tinker with them in exceptional circumstances.

- Performance is hard to reason about, and performant code often looks ugly
There's always a feeling of betrayal when you write beautiful code and have to dirty it with strictness annotations, pragmas, worker/wrapper transforms, and such to make it perform well. Having to provide both strict and lazy versions of every type, module, and function is stupid. Having to think about which to use is annoying. It's probably impossible to make this problem go away entirely, but I feel that significant advances should be possible relative to the status quo.

- Many people like to stick to standards-conforming code, but the standard is very slow to evolve.",3

On Windows, I need to install MinGW to simulate a Unix environment in order to get things working smoothly (need bash, gcc, autotools, etc), and MinGW by itself isn't enough, as many other libraries need to be obtained as well (GTK, SDL).  It takes a lot longer to set up.  Once it's working, it works great, but the initial setup can cost you a good hour or two of your time.  Also, on Windows, it's difficult to update cabal packages.

Space leaks require low-level under-the-hood understanding and need better support.",2,"Poor integration/collaboration on Hackage, with too many developers doing their own thing in their own way, making it frustrating for users to evaluate and choose between them.

A failed cabal update/install from Hackage should not break your entire system!  Resolving resultant lib conflicts can be messy and this alone would make me reluctant to suggest Haskell for a production environment.  No version of a package should be allowed on Hackage without clearly indicating which versions of which dependencies are required The existing <lib>.cabal dependency specs do not go far enough: libs unreasonably force a single dependency version (or narrow range) when a range (or wider range) would do and the user should not need to manually patch & recompile every lib.  Hackage has a lot of old/deprecated/apparently-unmaintained dependencies.  There is a real need for some dependency version resolution between compiler, cabal and Hackage (a la aptitude on Debian).  Ideally, Hackage uploads should be rejected if they do not correctly specify the widest possible dependency versions, or conform to official broad release timestamps.

Hackage needs some kind of overall stewardship and review/feedback from users.  Every kid doing their own thing in their own way is far too incoherent for real world use, and there is far to much partial overlap, and it's rapidly getting worse.  Projects should declare their intentions, methodology/approach, relationship to existing Hackage projects, scope for contributions, etc., and this should be reviewed, before even being allowed to upload.  Obviously there are legacy issues and ease of involvement should certainly not be discouraged, but maybe Hackage projects could be flagged with quality status badges for compliance or something similar?

Incidentally, the package categories on Hackage are useless and should be done away with.  They only add to the clutter.  And it's time to stop being proud of how many packages there are on Hackage - there are far too many overlapping packages!

Two other reasons why Haskell is not quite ready for prime time are that, in my experience, an inordinate amount of time is spent on:
* Static type compiler errors, when behaviour is not as expected.  Compiler diagnostic messages could be much more helpful.  The user should not have to reverse engineer GHC and/or wade through weeks of sprawling academic reading material to discover what is going on.
* Diagnosing space leaks requires low-level understanding of how the compiler works, and even then, they are often tricky to track down and rectify in practice.  Support in terms of tools and documentation (like the blogs by Edward Yang) are lacking.  It's unclear what the consequences are under the hood if strictness is enforced in user code.

In theoretical terms, the greatest weakness, IMHO, is that types and kinds are not first class objects.  There should be no second class objects.  There would be no need for many of the recent and ongoing research-driven extensions to GHC if this one simple issue could simply be addressed.  For this reason alone, Lisp will always be more powerful and expressive and less awkward.  Less crucially, a means to unify bindings at compile time would add to the expressiveness (alleviate the sense of semantic constraint) of the language.

Otherwise, I love the language and its community!",3

There's usually a lot of lifting involved.  It'd be easier if the type system and do-syntax would handle a lot of it for you.  For example, to combine Maybe and IO:

something :: () with (Maybe, IO)
something = do x <- failableIOOperation :: Int with (Maybe, IO)
                        y <- inputOperation :: Char with IO -- The same as IO Char

That would solve some issues, I think.

I also think more powerful macro integration like Lisp would be useful and help with some syntax issues, like custom sugar.  Expressions on their own lines being implicitly wrapped in parentheses would be nice.  For example:

map
   \x -> x * x

1) Library documentation -- I'm used to narrative docs with lots of real world examples. It would be helpful to see something along the lines of ""use function x when you want to perform task y"", rather than reading through a list of functions and possibly choosing to combine functions a and b to perform task y because you misread function x.

2) Lack of support for dev environments -- coming from Python where it's extremely easy and beneficial to build a virtualenv or sandbox environment, using cabal-dev requires a lot more work. And when you're trying to use it with packages like Yesod that rely on your main cabal folder or global variables, it either doesn't work or requires a lot of tweaking.

There is ample beginner/tutorial documentation, and extensive ""academic expert"" documentation (proofs, discussions of mathematical properties of zippers, etc). However, there is very little ""application writing"" documentation. The problem crops up most often with libraries. Often a library that does something very useful has no non-trivial examples included, and no discussion or tutorial of how to actually put it to use. The library's API functions are often described in terms of their mathematical properties rather than what you would use them for in a ""real"" program. 

A few libraries I've suffered this with include fclabels, data-accessor, fgl, and especially haxml. All of these are practically indispensable for writing applications, but have almost no application-oriented documentation. Haxml was a particularly sad case; I had to give up trying to understand it entirely due to the lack of useful documentation.

This type of documentation may seem to ""fall out"" from a mathematically-oriented understanding of the library (such as haxml's combinator scheme, or the concept of ""lenses"" in fclabels), but an application programmer does not have time to work through proofs of lens properties and then figure out what they might be good for in a program. Instead, the application programmer needs cookbook-style documentation to get something up and running, and then s/he can come to understand and make use of the underlying math. 

One of the few libraries that does this right is Parsec. fclabels at least had a reasonable toy example, but data-accessor fails epically in this regard.

If application programmers could ""get their programs started"" more easily, without having to burn so much time wading through math-oriented documentation, I believe Haskell would be more widely adopted. The existence of math-oriented documentation is a very good thing, and is quite helpful when you need to know about those properties, but such documentation is not sufficient for bootstrapping an application.",4

Missing or incomplete documentation for many packages, especially a lack of tutorials and examples.

At work, and under time pressure, this would make the use of Haskell a non-starter.

Diagnosing compiler error messages often requires much more sophisticated knowledge of the language and type system than a beginner has.  Maybe this is due to more of the theoretical underpinnings being exposed to the user?  But, the result is more stumbling blocks being encountered, thus slowing down progress.

First, I think the lack of an excellent ide keeps many programmers away. There should be an haskell equivalent of what Eclipse is for Java, and it should *work*. I use emacs haskell-mode, but it's rather primitive, even the command/function tab completion in the ghci inf-mode does not work!

There are  poor languages which are popular just because they have great development tools. Haskell is already a super language and better tools would really increase its popularity (imho).

Second, some of the basic libraries would benefit from a refresh. Simple example, Data.Map is missing insertWith' that applies the insertion function strictly. Why? And since it does not export the constructors (design flaw) implementing it by hand is contrived.

Another library that would need some love is Data.Array (maybe Repa could be a subsitute?).

At least the basic libraries should be free of design/implementation defects.",4

Not that I'm asking for one, but because you can't get a stack trace, it's very difficult to find where exceptions are coming from sometimes. High level exceptions are often descriptive enough to track down the issue, but low level stuff like calling Prelude.head on the empty list can be nightmarish to track down.

The type system prevents a great deal of runtime errors, but if you slip through a crack the runtime tools for debugging are not great. Ideally we could prevent low level issues at compile time.

Hopefully I feel this way because I haven't discovered the way to debug these kinds of errors yet!",2

It hasn't. Haskell is a fantastic tool, but the steepness of the learning curve hasn't changed, and I'm tired of evangelizing something that my coworkers aren't ever going to adopt. I'm evaluating go now as a language that can be evangelized with some hope of traction with the masses.

I think you're going to see more of this...fatigue. I don't think anyone presumes haskell will take over the world, but it really hasn't made much of a dent at all in industry from what I can tell. I wonder how long the enthusiasm can keep people interested.

Also, I really think many of the shootout submissions should be rewritten in a more idiomatic style. Haskell is promoted as a high-performance tool, but when it comes to benchmarks, we produce entrants that are not at all what we would consider idiomatic. I would rather see haskell move down the rankings with more honest, idiomatic submissions. Sorry for focusing on the shootout so much, but lets be honest, a lot of people look at that site.

It would be nice if we could get a solution where cabal could provide a simple build platform / shell environment where the gnu tools from the ghc installation would be exposed. Something like a specialized msys setup with a package management system (perhaps like the one used in arch linux). Cabal should then also have its own lib & include folders (besides the current bin folder). It could also be improved with a separate tools package for cabal that would install additional build tools not found in the regular ghc installation.

- Haskell hackers talk a lot about program correctness but I'm still waiting to see  any one in the Haskell world tackling program corrected as Dijskstra did. Actually ghc seems to have at least as many bugs as gcc, contradicting the idea that correctness comes for free with functional programming

- lazy evaluation and parallel computing seem to be at odds in GHC. Robert Harper has commented on that.

- Many libraries seem to attend just purpose of getting published papers. Example: Accelerate.

GHC is great but there are times where there's no known ""bug-free"" stable version.  Often bug fixes are not ported to the current stable version if the next version is already in sight. Advanced use (retainer profiling) sometimes crashes GHC.  It's still much harder to track down space leaks than it is with Java/Scala or Objective-C Tools (Instruments).

comfortably/ would be a great help. The interface that Leksah provides is a good start, I think... wish I were already better at Haskell so I could make a real contribution here, 
but I guess I still have too much to learn.

All in all, after a year or so of learning Haskell in my (scarce) spare time, I still have to
say it's the language with the nicest syntax and some of the coolest features I have seen so far in my computing career of about 25 years (if you also count C64 times ;) ).

Keep going, Haskell, you're way cooler than most others!

The IDE should be cross-platform and offer a single integration point for all Haskell's development tools, which I hope will continue to improve.  

Personally, I love that Haskell remains a research language, but I also need to know what the 'stable/trusted subset' is in order to be confident about deploying those features.  I want at least this subset to be supported by productivity tools that I can use reliably in a commercial software development environment.

As noted and clearly in the mind of this survey's author, reasoning about space and time is the single most tricky thing when programming in a lazy FL.  I can wax lyrical as much as anyone else about the representational benefits of Haskell and indeed all the robust compile-time type checking, but runtime performance _can_ be the thorn in the flesh.

The Haskell community is really great. There are certain gaps that intimidate or deter broader adoption.

Tutorial versus high performance code. Advanced programmers spend seem to spend a lot of time adding strictness, unboxing, and looking at GHC.Core. Pretty scary for a newbie trained on tutorial style code.

Type language, versus value language. Haskell is really two languages working together. One is the language of values, which is elegant. Then there is the type system, which is where all sorts of magic occurs in a ""difficult"" language. It's takes a while to  learn what to ignore when learning Haskell. Most programmers should not be worrying too much about advanced type system issues, but they need to know a little. The boundaries are not clear.

Type errors can seem very opaque to beginners and beyond. ""Inferred"" versus ""Expected"" took me forever to grok. Minor gripe.

I feel a little more attention from a broader audience would benefit haskell.
take nodejs as an example: the community is vibrant and a LOT of really god libraries and applications emerge. thus growing haskell more intensively  outside the realms of theoreticians might give a real boost for us as well...
having said this I really think haskell has done a tremendous job...especially with people like dons and Brian and tibbe. thanks for helping to put life into this wonderful language! oliver mueller
